Some General Terms and Definitions -
Protocols -

Protocol, in computer science, a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices,
such as computers. In order for computers to exchange information, there must be a preexisting agreement as to how the
information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it.
Internet Protocol -

The Internet Protocol (IP) is the network layer communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across
network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.
TCP -

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange
messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.
HTTP/HTTPS -

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication 
over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer
Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS,[3] or HTTP over SSL.
RTP -

The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a network protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks. RTP is used in communication
and entertainment systems that involve streaming media, such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC, television
services and web-based push-to-talk features.

API -

Application Program Interface or API, s a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

Three types of
    API’s -
    - Private - This API is only for the internal use of the company.
      This gives the company the most control over their api.
    - Partner - This API is shared with specific business partners.
      This can provide additional revenue streams without compromising quality.
    - Public - This API is available for everyone. This allows everyone to develop apps
      that interact with your API can be a source for innovation.
Web Servers -

A Web Server is a Software and it’s underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTPS( a secure variant of HTTP),
the network protocol created to distribute web pages.  A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates
communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that
resource or an error message. The server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.
REST API -

(Representational State Transfer) is a software architecture style that was created to guide the design and development of the
architecture of World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed 
hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave. The REST architectural style emphasizes the scalability of interactions
between components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, and the creation of a layered architecture to
facilitate caching components to reduce user-perceived latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.
REST API is basically composed of these functionalities

Create    —————> POST
Read      —————> GET
Update    —————> PUT
Delete    —————> DELETE
VPN -

A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive
data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. 
Applications running across a VPN may benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.
It provides access to resources inaccessible on the public network and is typically used for telecommuting workers. 
Encryption is common, although not an inherent part of a VPN connection.
